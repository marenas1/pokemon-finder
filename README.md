**Pokemon Finder** is a website that allows users to find pokemon specific to their liking by clicking different options for generation or type. All information is fetched from the PokeApi and then reformatted for easy viewing. Created as a project to showcase the ability to fetch multiple instances of information from an api and display and overwrite these values as necessary.
